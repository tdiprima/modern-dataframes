# Modern DataFrames

Well now, gather 'round and let me tell y'all about the finest collection of DataFrame wrangling techniques this side of the Python repository!

What started as a friendly competition between Polars and Pandas has blossomed into something mighty special. This here repo is your one-stop shop for learning how modern data processing libraries stack up against each other, and bless your heart, we've got examples that'll make your data sing.

## What's Cookin' in This Kitchen

**Performance Benchmarking** - We put Polars and Pandas head-to-head in a good old fashioned speed contest. Spoiler alert: Polars runs faster than a cat  (see `polars_pandas_benchmark.ipynb` for the proof).

**Advanced Polars Techniques** - Over 10 production-ready patterns that'll teach you how to wrangle data like a seasoned professional. From lazy evaluation to window functions, we've got all the fixins.

**Alternative Libraries** - Because sometimes you need the big guns for distributed computing (Dask, Modin), and we're fixin' to show you how they work too.

**Educational Tutorials** - Step-by-step guides with sample datasets, perfect for folks just starting out or veterans looking to expand their repertoire.
