Here are the key insights from each graph:

## Graph 1: Speed Improvement (Higher = Better)
This bar chart shows how many times faster Polars is compared to Pandas for each operation. The results are impressive across the board:

- **String operations lead** with 6.9x speedup - Polars' optimized string processing really shines here
- **Loading comes second** at 6.7x faster - Polars' efficient CSV parser significantly outperforms Pandas
- **Filtering is 5.6x faster** - Polars' lazy evaluation and columnar processing excel at boolean operations
- **Sorting shows 4.0x improvement** - Still substantial, though the smallest gain of the operations tested
- **GroupBy operations are 3.6x faster** - Solid improvement for aggregation workloads

All operations show significant speedups well above the "no improvement" baseline, demonstrating Polars' consistent performance advantages.

## Graph 2: Execution Time Comparison (Log Scale)
This chart shows the actual execution times on a logarithmic scale, revealing the magnitude of time differences:

- **Loading** shows the largest absolute time gap - Pandas takes over 1 second while Polars completes in ~0.15 seconds
- **String operations** demonstrate dramatic efficiency - Polars finishes in milliseconds while Pandas takes much longer
- **Filtering** shows Pandas struggling with complex conditions while Polars handles them efficiently
- **GroupBy and Sorting** show more modest but still substantial time differences

The log scale helps visualize how Polars consistently operates an order of magnitude faster across most operations.

## Graph 3: Memory Usage Comparison
This chart reveals interesting memory usage patterns:

- **Loading shows mixed results** - Polars actually uses slightly more memory (230MB vs 200MB), likely due to its optimized internal data structures
- **Filtering uses minimal memory** for both libraries, with Polars being more efficient
- **GroupBy operations** show Polars using significantly more memory (115MB vs 20MB) - this suggests Polars may pre-allocate or maintain additional data structures for performance
- **String operations** show Polars being very memory-efficient
- **Sorting** shows similar memory usage between both libraries

The memory story is nuanced - Polars sometimes trades memory for speed, but often achieves both better performance and efficiency.

## Graph 4: Performance Heatmap (Green = Better)
This normalized heatmap provides an overall performance summary across all metrics:

- **Deep green across most cells** indicates Polars consistently outperforms Pandas
- **The red areas in filtering and groupby memory** highlight where Polars uses more memory (matching Graph 3)
- **String operations show perfect green** - Polars dominates in both time and memory for text processing
- **Loading and sorting** show excellent overall performance despite some memory trade-offs

The predominantly green heatmap confirms that Polars delivers superior performance across most dimensions, with memory usage being the only area where trade-offs occasionally occur.

**Bottom Line**: Polars demonstrates 3.6-6.9x speedups across all operations while generally being more memory-efficient, making it a compelling choice for data-intensive workloads. The occasional higher memory usage appears to be a worthwhile trade-off for the substantial performance gains.
