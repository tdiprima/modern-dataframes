# ⚡️ Polars Advanced Techniques

Welcome to the *cool zone* of data wrangling. We've got hands-on examples showing off **next-level Polars moves** for efficient data processing. Each Python file dives into a specific feature.

## 🧩 Setup

Grab your deps with `uv`:

```bash
uv add polars numpy
```

## 📁 Files Breakdown

Each file's got a purpose:

* **lazy_evaluation.py** → Chill with lazy CSV reading + slick aggregations
* **window_functions.py** → Analytics but make it ✨windowed✨
* **struct_columns.py** → Nested struct data? We got layers
* **concat_str.py** → String building with ifs and whens
* **map_batches.py** → Roll your own custom batch logic
* **sql_query.py** → Query your DataFrames like it's SQL Saturday
* **read_database.py** → Partitioned DB reads, because parallel = power
* **concat_diagonal.py** → Merge DataFrames that don't quite match
* **rolling_functions.py** → Time-series rolling stats, smooth like butter
* **list_methods.py** → Fancy tricks for list columns

## 🚀 How to Run

Just run any script and watch the magic happen.
Data efficiency? *Maxed out.* Performance? *Certified speedy.*
