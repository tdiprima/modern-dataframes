# Demonstrates partitioned database reads in Polars for efficient large data imports.
# Note: This is an example; replace with actual connection details. No real database connection is executed here.

import polars as pl

query = "SELECT * FROM logs WHERE timestamp >= '2024-01-01'"

# Example usage (commented out as it requires a real database)
# df = pl.read_database(
#     query=query,
#     connection="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mydb",
#     partition_on="timestamp",
#     partition_num=8
